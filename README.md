Fling
-----

to understand: clone, cd into repo, `./fling`

---

Fling is a command launcher.  Plug in *anything* and get bash autocompletion support by just symlinking the command into the fling config dir.

Any time you would have reached for `make` (but don't really want to put up with ".PHONY" declarations and other last-century bullshit) or `rake` (but don't want to deal with the whole ruby ecosystem), reach for Fling instead.
It's pure eyewatering-but-portable bash.
